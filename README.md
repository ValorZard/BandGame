# Mangrove City Rock!

A rock musical rhythm game/visual novel made in Godot 4.1.1, starring a rock band going through tough times. Over the course of the game, the characters struggle with moving on, and growing up.

The aesthetics are inspired by late 90s/early 2000s video games and anime, but the setting it takes place in is heavily inspired by the locales of southern India, especially Chennai.

The soundtrack is inspired by 90s/early 2000s punk and rock, like Nirvana, Green Day, and Paramore
